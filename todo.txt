1: single quotes are literal
2: env check is supposedly too eager <-- This seems okay
3: '|' && ';' <-- '|' stdout -> stdin ';' Do full command, then next
4: '\' escape characters <-- Not sure how to go about this
5: multifile redirections <-- in theory should be okay

and a bunch of other shit i do not know at the time being.
