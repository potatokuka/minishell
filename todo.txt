1: single quotes are literal - FIXED!!

3: '|' - WORKING!!
3.1: ';' - WORKING!!
4: '\' escape characters <---- FIXED!
5: multifile redirections <-- WORKING!!
6: recursive string join <- FIXED!!

7: \$ must be able to escape env variable from being checked <-- FIXED!!
8: throw error on trailing |

10: Exit status
	The return status (see Exit Status) of a simple command is its exit status as provided by the POSIX 1003.1 waitpid function, or 128+n if the command was terminated by signal n.
	`cat` then `^C` should set $? to 130
	`cd nonexistent` shoud set $? to 1
11:	no exit on non fatal errors

	10/11, change put error to flow back into prompt, by setting data to null and doing if(put_error) return ;
			add an arg `exit_code` to put_error and set the error code appropraitely
			set $? in signals aswel
