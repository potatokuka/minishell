1: single quotes are literal - FIXED!!

3: '|' - WORKING!!
3.1: ';' - WORKING!!
4: '\' escape characters <---- FIXED!
5: multifile redirections <-- WORKING!!
6: recursive string join <- FIXED!!
7: ;; input <-- FIXED!!
7: \$ must be able to escape env variable from being checked <-- FIXED!!
8: throw error on trailing | <-- FIXED!!
9: empty env var (check for segs) <-- CHECKED, none :) but thats with $? still set
10: Exit status <-- DONE!!
11:	no exit on non fatal errors <-- Unclosed quote and trailing pipes implemented, anything else?
