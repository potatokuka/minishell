PARSE OUT QUOTES ALWAYS NOW
ALSO NEED TO KILL LEADING SPACES

---BUILD TODAY---
* function that kills all certain CHAR 'c' from string

When reading line, save first command, as well as anything directly
  after ';' and '|' -> prob done later

Now take the INPUT[RES] and construct a DISPATCHER:
DISPATCHER--
first to do, 16/06 ->
echo --> check the first 5 char and for closed "STR"
exit --> get this working so we don't go nuts
feel free to tell me what to do in here

-+-+-+-+-+-
GET input from GNL
malloc *input
TRIM all leading spaces to first char
>>> ^^^ move pointer to first ALPHA char
use if_alpha on INPUT to find first alpha
save first word until space or end of string

---*---*---*----
take rest of INPUT
RULES:
alpha count always
space directly after alpha COUNT
inside of quations always save, first occurance last end
'\' in quotes save, '\\' save 1
have to have an EVEN number of backslash
